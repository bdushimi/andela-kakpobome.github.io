React, Node) software stack. As well as an immersive, experiential process of learning the soft skills required to thrive as a professional in any distributed engineering team. </p> </details> <details> <summary>How much does it cost to hire Andela Apprentices?</summary> <p> $0. Yes, absolutely nothing! It’s a win win. You get to try awesome engineering talent for free within a 3 month period and you can decide to hire them full time once they've proven to add value to your team. On our end, we get to continue upskilling the Apprentices until we believe they’re totally ready to join the job ecosystem. </p> </details> <details> <summary>How long would they be available to me for free?</summary> <p> For a period of 3 months after they start working with you. Afterwards, you have to either hire them or let them roll off your team gracefully. </p> </details> <details> <summary>Ok, but can I hire them directly if I like their work?</summary> <p> Of course! Once the 3 month period from when they start working with you is up, you can go on ahead to hire them immediately. If you’d like to hire sooner, and prefer not to continue the “3 month trial”, that’s also possible! </p> </details> <details> <summary>What support do I get from Andela when I hire these Apprentices?</summary> <ul> <li> Performance management. We provide a strong and tight feedback loop between the Apprentice and your Engineering manager/lead to make sure they’re fully aware of your expectations from them and act accordingly. </li> <li> If it so happens that after weeks of feedback, you’re still unhappy with a particular Apprentice’s performance, we roll them off your team and replace them at your request. </li> <li> We hold monthly technical workshops as well as coaching sessions, to make sure we’re able to impart them with more knowledge than they’re potentially exposed to on their engagements. Armed with such knowledge, they become more of an asset on your team, as they’re able to bring fresh ideas to old and new challenges alike. </li> </ul> </details> <details> <summary>What’s the difference between Andela and the Andela Technical Leadership Program?</summary> <ul> <li> Good question. Andela here refers to the company you know and love whose mission is to distribute as many available opportunities to all available talent, world wide. Specifically, to achieve this as a global company, we plan to create infrastructure that ensures we’re able to place the right talent at the right time for as many companies that need such talent. </li> <li> However, Andela Rwanda has a responsibility to implement this mission by sourcing talent from within Africa and train them to become world class junior engineers. </li> <li> The Andela Technical Leadership Program(ATLP) is the vehicle with which Andela Rwanda is making that happen. It consists of a 5 month intensive technical and soft skills training, a 3 month Apprenticeship with a reputable tech company and a 2 week career coaching program. </li> </ul> </details> <details> <summary>Love this! Can I send potential employees to Andela to train them before I employ them?</summary> <p> We like how you think! Right now, we don’t train for specific competencies on request, you’d simply have to refer them to apply to the program, and we can arrange for them to Apprentice with your company. However, watch this space for more interesting developments around this! </p> </details> </section> <footer> <small class="copyright mobile-only">Copyright &copy; Andela Rwanda Ltd 2020</small> <div id="logos"> <img id="andela-logo-footer" alt="Andela logo" src="https://3xyh3sqxv063a8xzo5uk2zn1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Andela-Logo-White-Landscape-300px.png"> <img id="soc-badge" alt="SOC validation badge" src="https://3xyh3sqxv063a8xzo5uk2zn1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/21972-312_SOC_NonCPA.png"> <small class="copyright" id="main-copyright">Copyright &copy; Andela Rwanda Ltd 2020</small> </div> <div id="links"> <a href="https://andela.com" target="_blank">Andela Global INC</a> <a href="https://andela.com/modernslaverystatement" target="_blank">Modern Slavery Statement</a> <a href="https://andela.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms Of Use</a> <a href="https://andela.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> </div> <h5 id="links-header" class="mobile-only">USEFUL LINKS</h5> </footer> <script type="text/javascript"></script>  <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-CGQJDS9FYC"></script> <script>function a(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[],a("js",new Date),a("config","G-CGQJDS9FYC");</script> </body></html>
